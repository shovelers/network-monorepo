# Network

Creole Network is a peer-to-peer network, on which each participant gets a ‘Personal Information Store’ through which their ‘agents’ can exchange contact information via handshakes such as ‘join, ‘follow’, etc. DCN provides seamless people search to the participants across the network and also provides a low-code stack to developers for building user-centric social utility apps. 

## Architecture

The fundamental unit of the network is **Account**, whose actions are executed through their **Agents**. Each device of an Account is represented on the network as an Agent.
- These agents manage the “**account-fs**” of the **account** across devices and apps. It is designed to store personal information such as 
    > **Profile, Contacts, Groups, Graphs, Calendar, Credentials and Notes**
- **Handshakes** are protocols for exchanging personal information amongst agents. Social interactions such as ‘**join** a community’, ‘**connect** with a member’, ‘**invite** a friend’ etc. are modelled as **Handshakes**, through which agents exchange personal information over an encrypted messaging layer.
- **People Search API** is a special-purpose search engine for agents to query contacts & graphs stored in account-fs and in turn enable search, similarity, and recommendations.

## Local setup 

To bring up the 'rolodex' application, follow the below steps 
-  Run ```npm install``` at the project directory to install the dependencies.
-  Run ```npm start -w hub``` at the project directory to bring up the hub.
-  Run ```npm start -w rolodex 4000``` at the project directory to bring up the rolodex application on port 4000. The application will be up on http://localhost:4000/

Currently, 'rolodex' requires the 'hub' to be up as well for it to work. 

### Major Dependencies
- 'Hub' requires [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/) to run, the assumption is that redis will run on port 6379. One can refer the 'package.json' file of 'hub' for the appropriate redis version to be installed.
